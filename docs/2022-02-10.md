# Day 1

Agenda for today is to run some E2E tests in https://github.com/appium/appium-remote-debugger/ and set some breakpoints in VSCode and just step through the code and see what's going on. Will take notes here as I go.

## Starting E2E Tests
* Testing in iOS 14.4 and iPhone 12 Pro Max (PLATFORM_VERSION and DEVICE_NAME). Can't do iOS 15 because I don't have the latest Xcode
* getWebInspectorSocket() from iOS Simulator code
    * Saw that "appium-remote-debugger" runs a command called `lsof -aUc launchd_sim` and then fishes out "/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.O5Sei0aq4a/com.apple.webinspectord_sim.socket" from the list. What is this file and what does it do? "webinspectord" likely means "WebInspector daemon".

* createRemoteDebugger

    ```javascript
    createRemoteDebugger({
      bundleId: 'com.apple.mobilesafari', // Bundle ID of Safari on iOS Simulator and Real Devices
      isSafari: true, // Legacy because used to be Chrome too?
      useNewSafari: true, // Freshly installed Safari
      pageLoadMs: 1000, // ????
      platformVersion: PLATFORM_VERSION, // iOS version
      socketPath: await sim.getWebInspectorSocket(), 
      garbageCollectOnExecute: false,
      isSimulator: true,
      logAllCommunication: true,
      logAllCommunicationHexDump: false, // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20hex%20dump,computer%20file%20or%20storage%20device.&text=Some%20hex%20dumps%20have%20the,simply%20dump%20or%20even%20D%20.
    }, false);
    ```
    * Creates an instance of "remote debugger" class.

* remote-debugger.js --> setup()

    ```javascript
    // app handling configuration
    this.appDict = {};
    this.appIdKey = null;
    this.pageIdKey = null;
    this.pageLoading = false;
    this._navigatingToPage = false;
    this.allowNavigationWithoutReload = false;
    ```

    * I remember "appDict" and "appIdKey" and "pageIdKey" being important from when I debugged the Safari issue

* connect.js --> connect ()

* rpc-client-simulator.js --> connect ()
  * `Connecting to remote debugger through unix domain socket: '/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.3MN1SgJ997/com.apple.webinspectord_sim.socket`

* connect.js --> setConnectKey ()

* rpc
  * sends and receives messages
  * `__selector` is of the format `_rpc_<name>` which presumably means a "procedure" or "method" name
  * `__argument` is an object with key -> value pairings. The keys all start with `WIR` (e.g.: `WIRConnectionIdentifierKey`)
    * I'm guessing that `WIR` means `Web Inspector`?
  * send and receive are the same format
  * 

* "simctl" opens the URL. Not remote debugger.

* `startWebInspectorService` from "ios-device" is where the socket service is created


## To-do's
* Update my macOS version so that I can get iOS 15 running locally
* Should try with a real device when I get a chance
* Will need to understand "ios-device"
* `sendToDevice()` method <-- a lot to unpack there
* `getPossibleDebuggerAppKeys()` for finding the Safari app
* `Page.enable`, etc... how does this all work?

## Questions
* How to run the "remote debugger" with verbose logging
* What exactly is `usbmuxd`?
